I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor, Prof. Guangwu Xu, for the patient guidance, encouragement and invaluable advice he has provided throughout my time as his student. I have been extremely lucky to have a supervisor who cared so much about my work, and who responded to my questions and queries so promptly. I can not forget the valuable conversation with and suggestion of Dr. Xu. This thesis would not have been possible without the inspiration and support of Dr. Xu and his guidance into the world of cryptography has been a valuable input for this thesis.
